description: Customize the sidebar with templates, styling, and per-agent icons
---

The sidebar renders each agent row from a small token-based template DSL. You
can override the built-in templates per layout mode:

```yaml
sidebar:
  templates:
    # Compact mode: a single line per agent.
    compact: "{status_icon} {primary} {pane_suffix} {fill} {elapsed}"

    # Tile mode: one string per visual line in the tile body.
    tiles:
      - "{primary} {pane_suffix} {fill} {elapsed}"
      - "{secondary} {fill} {git_stats}"
      - "{pane_title} {fill} {pr_number} {pr_checks}"

    # Horizontal mode: one string per visual line in each top bar chip.
    horizontal:
      - "{status_icon} {primary} {pane_suffix} {fill} {elapsed}"
      - "{secondary} {fill} {git_stats}"
      - "{pane_title} {fill} {pr_number} {pr_checks}"

    # Used instead of the templates above while sidebar.group_by is set.
    # Anything left out falls back to the template of the same name above,
    # then to the grouped default.
    grouped:
      header: "{group} {fill} {group_count}"
      tiles:
        - "{primary} {pane_suffix} {fill} {pr_number} {pr_checks} {elapsed}"
        - "{pane_title} {fill} {git_stats}"
```

The values shown above are also the built-in defaults, so leaving these keys
unset gives you the standard rendering. `top` is also accepted as an alias for
`horizontal`.

Templates can be set in either the global config or a project's `.workmux.yaml`.
Project values override global values field by field, so a project that sets
only `grouped.tiles` keeps the global `compact`, `tiles` and `horizontal`
templates. Changes are picked up live by running
sidebars without a restart.

## Tokens

| Token            | Description                                                                                                                                     |

| `{project}`      | Project name (parent of the worktree).                                                                                                          |
| `{session}`      | Tmux session name (blank for workmux-prefixed sessions).                                                                                        |
| `{window}`       | Tmux window name (blank for generic shell names like `zsh`, `bash`).                                                                            |

| `{pane_title}`   | Sanitized agent task title from the pane title.                                                                                                 |
| `{pane_suffix}`  | Disambiguator like `(1)`, `(2)` when multiple agents share a window. Empty otherwise.                                                           |
| `{status_icon}`  | Status indicator (working spinner, waiting, done, sleeping, etc.).                                                                              |
| `{agent_icon}`   | Per-agent icon based on the running agent's profile (see [Agent identity](#agent-identity)).                                                    |
| `{agent_label}`  | Capitalized agent name (e.g. `Claude`, `Codex`).                                                                                                |
| `{elapsed}`      | Elapsed time since the agent's last status change.                                                                                              |
| `{git_stats}`    | Composite git diff stats: committed (`+1278 -400`), pen icon, uncommitted (`+21`). Self-degrades to fit the space it gets.                      |
| `{git_branch}`   | Current branch name. Empty when detached HEAD or git status unavailable.                                                                        |
| `{pr_number}`    | Pull request number as `#123`. Empty when the current branch has no matching PR.                                                                |
| `{pr_checks}`    | GitHub check status for the current remote branch, with counts when space allows. Empty when no checks are known.                               |
| `{git_ahead}`    | Commits ahead of upstream as `↑N` when N greater than 0. Empty when 0 or no upstream.                                                           |
| `{git_behind}`   | Commits behind upstream as `↓N` when N greater than 0. Empty when 0 or no upstream.                                                             |
| `{git_dirty}`    | Diff glyph when the working tree is dirty. Empty when clean.                                                                                    |
| `{git_conflict}` | Conflict glyph when the worktree has merge conflicts. Empty otherwise.                                                                          |
| `{status_label}` | Display name for the agent status: `Working`, `Waiting`, `Done`, or empty when no status.                                                       |
| `{idx}`          | 1-based position among the sidebar's agents; group headers are not counted.                                                                     |
| `{jump_key}`     | The `M-1`..`M-9` chord label for the first nine rows. Empty for row 10 and beyond.                                                              |
| `{fill}`         | Layout marker that splits a line into a left and right segment. At most one per line.                                                           |

Group headers use their own token set, and agent tokens are rejected there
because a header does not represent one agent:

| Token            | Description                                                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `{group}`        | Group name: the project name or the tmux session name.                   |
| `{group_count}`  | Number of agents the sidebar shows in the group, sleeping ones included. |
| `{group_status}` | Status tally for the group, using your status icons, most urgent first.  |

`{group}` is flexible, so a long group name truncates before `{group_count}` is
dropped.

`{group_status}` says what a group holds rather than how much, which is what you
want from a group you cannot see inside: one that is folded, or scrolled out of
view behind the pinned header. It is not in the default header:

```yaml
sidebar:
  templates:
    grouped:
      header: "{group} {fill} {group_status} {group_count}"
```

One pair per status present, counting waiting, done, working and stale agents in
that order. An idle agent has no icon of its own, so it is left out of the tally
while `{group_count}` still counts it. When the header runs out of room the
least urgent pairs drop first.

`{git_ahead}` and `{git_behind}` already include the arrow prefix, so do not
wrap them with another `↑` / `↓` literal in your template, otherwise a stray
glyph would remain when the count is zero. The same applies to `{git_dirty}`
and `{git_conflict}`, which are self-contained glyph indicators.

`{pr_number}` is populated from the current git branch's matching GitHub pull
request. It renders empty on `main`/`master`, when the branch has no PR, when git
status is unavailable, or while PR data has not been fetched yet.

`{pr_checks}` is populated from the matching pull request's head commit when a PR
exists, then from the remote branch tip when the branch has no PR check data.
On `main` and `master`, only failing checks render. Local-only branches and
commits that have not been pushed render empty. Check status shows an icon and,
when space allows, passed/total counts for pending or failing checks.

Unknown tokens or unbalanced braces cause that template section to be rejected
and the previous valid section (or the built-in default) is kept. The sidebar
also shows a visible warning such as `template error: unknown token 'pr_status'
at column 1 in tiles[0]` until the template is fixed.

## Layout

`{fill}` is the only layout marker. Tokens before it form the left segment and
tokens after it form the right segment. The leftmost flex token in the left
segment absorbs ellipsis-truncation when there isn't enough room. Flex tokens
are: `{primary}`, `{secondary}`, `{worktree}`, `{project}`, `{session}`,
`{window}`, `{pane_title}`, `{group}`. Other tokens always render at their natural width.

When a line has more slack than the flex token needs, the leftover is emitted as
spaces between the left and right segments, so right-segment tokens like
`{elapsed}` line up against the right edge.

When a token resolves to an empty string, one adjacent literal whitespace is
dropped automatically. This means `{primary} {pane_suffix} {fill} {elapsed}`
renders cleanly whether or not `{pane_suffix}` is empty.

In tile mode, the stripe, status icon column, and a 1-column right margin are
drawn as chrome by the renderer. Templates only control the body area, so line
alignment between tiles is automatic. A tile line containing a field still
renders as a row when that field is empty, preserving tile height for templates
like the default `{pane_title}` row. Use a blank string in the `tiles` list to
skip that row entirely.

In horizontal mode, each configured `horizontal` line renders inside every chip.
The bar shows as many lines as its current height permits, so height 1 uses only
the first line, height 2 also shows the secondary label and git stats, and height
3 also shows the pane title.

## Escaping

Use `{{` for a literal `{` and `}}` for a literal `}`.

## Styling

Templates accept the same tmux-style `#[...]` directives that workmux uses
elsewhere (see [configuration](/guide/configuration/#agent-status-icons)). A
directive is stateful: it applies to all subsequent literals, fields, and
fill spaces on the same line until the next directive or `#[default]`. Each
line starts with no overlay.

```yaml
sidebar:
  templates:
    compact: "{status_icon} #[fg=cyan]{primary}#[default] {fill} {elapsed}"
    tiles:
      - "#[fg=cyan,bold]{primary}#[default] {pane_suffix} {fill} {elapsed}"
      - "{secondary} {fill} #[fg=green]{git_stats}#[default]"
      - "{pane_title} {fill} {pr_checks}"
```

Supported attributes are `fg=`, `bg=`, `bold`, `dim`, `italics`,
`underscore`, `reverse`, `strikethrough`, their negations (`nobold`,
`nodim`, `noitalics`, `nounderscore`, `noreverse`, `nostrikethrough`)
to remove a modifier inherited from the token's intrinsic style, plus
`default`/`none` to clear the overlay. Colors may be hex (`#a6e3a1`),
named (`red`, `green`, `cyan`, etc.), or indexed (`colour196`).

For example, `{elapsed}` renders dim by default for visual hierarchy.
To override:

```yaml
sidebar:
  templates:
    tiles:
      - "{primary} {pane_suffix} {fill} #[fg=cyan,nodim]{elapsed}"
```

Notes:

- Style codes are zero-width. They never affect `{fill}` alignment or
  ellipsis truncation.
- Stale rows ignore template styling so the dim state remains visually
  authoritative.
- The active row's bold and the selected row's background highlight are
  preserved; user `fg` patches over the active foreground while keeping
  bold. A user `bg=` will hide the selection highlight on the styled span.
- An unclosed `#[...` is rendered as literal text; malformed directives
  inside `#[...]` are silently ignored.

## Agent identity

Adding `{agent_icon}` or `{agent_label}` to a template surfaces which agent is
running in each pane. Identity is detected from the stored agent command via
the same profile system used elsewhere in workmux.

Default icons:

- `claude` → `CC`
- `codex` → `CX`
- `opencode` → `OC`
- `gemini` → `G`
- `pi` → `π`
- `omp` → `⌥`
- `kiro-cli` → `K`
- `vibe` → `V`
- `copilot` → `CP`
- `grok` → `GK`

Unknown agents render an empty icon.

Default colors are brand accents: Claude orange, Codex teal, Gemini blue,
Copilot purple, Grok blue, Vibe orange, Pi sage, OMP red/orange, OpenCode blue. Stale rows still dim
and selected rows still take the highlight background; the icon color sits
on top of those.

Override icons or colors per agent under `sidebar.agent_icons`. Each value
is either a bare string (icon only, default color stays) or an object with
`icon` and `color`. Color values use the same format as `theme.custom`:
hex (`'#ff8c00'`), named ANSI (`red`, `yellow`, `lightgreen`), or indexed
(`'214'`).

```yaml
sidebar:
  agent_icons:
    # Bare string: icon only, default brand color stays
    vibe: V

    # Override color only
    gemini:
      color: cyan

    # Override both
    claude:
      icon: CC
      color: "#ff8c00"

    # Disable the default color (use palette text color)
    codex:
      color: ""
```

A project-level `agent_icons` map merges into the global one per agent
key. Setting `claude:` in a project replaces only the global `claude`
entry; other agents defined in the global config are preserved. To
clear an inherited override entirely for one agent, set its value to
`null` (e.g. `claude: ~`).

## Status icons

The `{status_icon}` token renders the working spinner, waiting indicator,
done check, and sleeping indicator. Defaults depend on whether you have
[nerdfont](/guide/configuration/) enabled:

| State    | Default (no nerdfont) | Default (nerdfont) |
| -------- | --------------------- | ------------------ |
| Working  | braille spinner       | braille spinner    |
| Waiting  | 💬                    | nf-fa-comment      |
| Done     | ✅                    | nf-md-check_circle |
| Sleeping | 💤                    | nf-md-sleep        |

Override per state under top-level `status_icons`. Any value set here
wins over both the emoji and nerdfont defaults, so you can mix and match.
Setting `working` also replaces the braille spinner with a static icon:

```yaml
status_icons:
  working: "🤖"
  waiting: "💬"
  done: "✅"
```

## Examples

Show only the worktree and elapsed time per agent in compact mode:

```yaml
sidebar:
  layout: compact
  templates:
    compact: "{status_icon} {worktree} {fill} {elapsed}"
```

Add the agent icon next to the primary label in tile mode:

```yaml
sidebar:
  templates:
    tiles:
      - "{agent_icon} {primary} {pane_suffix} {fill} {elapsed}"
      - "{secondary} {fill} {git_stats}"
      - "{pane_title} {fill} {pr_checks}"
```

Configure only two tile lines and show git stats inline on line one:

```yaml
sidebar:
  templates:
    tiles:
      - "{primary} {fill} {git_stats}"
      - "{secondary} {fill} {elapsed}"
```

Show pull request number and GitHub check status in tile mode:

```yaml
sidebar:
  templates:
    tiles:
      - "{primary} {pane_suffix} {fill} {elapsed}"
      - "{secondary} {fill} {git_stats}"
      - "{pane_title} {fill} {pr_number} {pr_checks}"
```
